# The Elevation Ritual

Everyone’s goal is to rise up in the Trantorian hierarchy.  
This ritual, which enhances physical and mental capacities must be done according to a particular rite: they must gather the following on the same unit of terrain:

- At least a certain number of each stones
- At least a certain number of players with the same level

The elevation begins as soon as a player initiates the incantation.  
It is not necessary for the players to be on the same team; they only need to be of the same level.  
Every player in a group doing an incantation attain the higher level.  
Passed down from generation to generation, the elevation secret comes down to this:

| Elevation | Nb Players | Linemate | Deraumere | Sibur | Mendiane | Phiras | Thystame |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| 1->2      | 1          | 1        | 0         | 0     | 0        | 0      | 0        |
| 2->3      | 2          | 1        | 1         | 1     | 0        | 0      | 0        |
| 3->4      | 2          | 2        | 0         | 1     | 0        | 2      | 0        |
| 4->5      | 4          | 1        | 1         | 2     | 0        | 1      | 0        |
| 5->6      | 4          | 1        | 2         | 1     | 3        | 0      | 0        |
| 6->7      | 6          | 1        | 2         | 3     | 0        | 1      | 0        |
| 7->8      | 6          | 2        | 2         | 2     | 2        | 2      | 1        |

The verification of the prerequisites for the incantation is done at the beginning and at the end of the action.
