# Individuals

The inhabitants are bodiless, blurry and takes up the entire tile they are in.  
They are pacifists. They are neither violent nor aggressive.  
They eat and meander happily in search of stones.  
They easily run into their fellow creatures on the same tile.  

Trantorians can see as far as their visual capacities allow.  
It is impossible to distinguish their direction when we run into them.  
The food the Trantorians collect is the only resource they need to survive.  
One unit of food allows them to live for 126 time units.
