# Geography

The game is about managing a world and its inhabitants.  
This world, Trantor is geographically made of zero-relief planes: no craters, no valleys, no mountains.  
The game board represents the entirety of this worldâ€™s surface, like a world map.

If a player exits by the right of the board, they will come back through the left. Up->down, and so on...
