# Resources

The environment is rather rich in resources (mineral as well as dietary).  
Therefore, by walking around this planet, the players can find succulent food and a variety of natural stones.  
These stones have six distinct categories, as follows:

- **Linemate**
- **Deraumere**
- **Sibur**
- **Mendiane**
- **Phiras**
- **Thystame**

The server spawns resources upon starting and every 20 time units.  
It follows this set of rules:

- on Trantor you must find at least one of each ressource and food on the floor.
- resources should be evenly spread across the map.
- the ressource quantity can be found with the following formula: `map_width * map_height * density`

| Resource | Density |
|----------|---------|
| Food     | 0.5     |
| Linemate | 0.3     |
| Deraumere| 0.15    |
| Sibur    | 0.1     |
| Mendiane | 0.1     |
| Phiras   | 0.08    |
| Thystame | 0.05    |

for instance on a 10 by 10 world there is 50 food and 5 thystame.
