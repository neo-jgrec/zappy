# Player Reproduction

A player can reproduce thanks to the **fork** command.  
The execution of this command leads to the production of an egg.  
Once itâ€™s layed, the player who has layed it can take care of their business.  
Once the egg is layed, a new slot is added to the team.

:::warning
This operation authorizes a new client to be connected.

The **connect_nbr** command sends back the number of connections that are underway and authorized for this family.
