# Teams

In the beginning of the game, a team has n slot(s) available (represented on the board by an egg waiting for a client to connect).  
Each player is driven by a client.  
The clients cannot communicate or exchange data outside of the game (no matter what it is, it should be passed via the server).  
In the beginning, the player has 10 life units, which means they can survive for 1260 time units, or 1260 / f seconds.
