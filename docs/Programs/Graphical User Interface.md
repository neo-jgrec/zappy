# Graphical User Interface

The project must include a graphic visualization.  
It should be a representation of the world.

The interface must integrate at least a 2D visualization via intermediary icons, which must also allow a representation of the world to be seen.  
A 3D interface, or any other type of representation, will be a greatly appreciated asset. Still, remember that the graphical interface must be functional before being visually appealing.  

In order to develop this interface, you must use C++ and remember that you’ll need to handle incoming and outgoing data the right way with buffering as in the server.

:::warning
The GUI authenticates itself as such to the server by sending `GRAPHIC` when the server waits for the team’s name.

:::warning
For 2D renders, we greatly encourage you to use the SFML because you should already know how it works.

To know more about our GUI, I invite you to read the [GUI documentation](/docs/Programs/GUI).
