## Resources

The environment is rich in resources (both mineral and dietary). By walking around this planet, players can find succulent food and a variety of natural stones. These stones have six distinct categories:

- linemate
- deraumere
- sibur
- mendiane
- phiras
- thystame

The server spawns resources upon starting and every 20 time units, following these rules:

- At least one of each resource and food must be found on the floor.

- Resources should be evenly spread across the map.

- The resource quantity is determined by: map_width * map_height * density



| Resource  | Density |
|-----------|---------|
| food      | 0.5     |
| linemate  | 0.3     |
| deraumere | 0.15    |
| sibur     | 0.1     |
| mendiane  | 0.1     |
| phiras    | 0.08    |
| thystame  | 0.05    |


For example, on a 10 by 10 world, there would be 50 food and 5 thystame.
