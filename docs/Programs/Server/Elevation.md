## The Elevation Ritual

The goal is to rise up in the Trantorian hierarchy. This ritual requires gathering specific resources and a number of players of the same level on the same tile. The elevation begins as soon as a player initiates the incantation. Players can be from different teams but must be of the same level. All players involved in the incantation are frozen during the ritual. Once the ritual succeeds, the stones are removed from the terrain.
