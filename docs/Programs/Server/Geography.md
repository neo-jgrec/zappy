## Geography

The game is about managing a world and its inhabitants. This world, Trantor, is geographically made of zero-relief planes: no craters, no valleys, no mountains. The game board represents the entirety of this worldâ€™s surface, like a world map. If a player exits by the right of the board, they will come back through the left, and similarly for up and down.
