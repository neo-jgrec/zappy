## Scope

Here is the documentation about zappy's bots:
- Functionning
- Machine Learning

## Functionning 🧑‍💼

### Probabilistic

We use a probability graph to take the worther actions.

* **V1**: We put ourselves the probabilties.

* **V2**: We train a model that calculates probabilities.

## Machine Learning 📖

### Integration
* An **ia** is an informatic programm that got:
    * Perception: Interaction with an environment or datas
    * Decision: Execute actions or solve problems.

Our bot do actions depending on the worth rate of an action. We calculate each turn which actions is worther depending on the state.<br>

Our models is ML trained by genetic algorithms.

**Fitness**: “Fitness” is used to evaluate the quality of candidate solutions in the current population. Each individual (or candidate solution) is evaluated based on a fitness function that quantifies their fitness or performance relative to the overall objective.

## Strategies 🥷
